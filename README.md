## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
**Smart Parking:** Solution for parking availability

## SOLUTION:
Urban areas are facing a growing parking crisis due to the rising population and vehicular traffic. The increasing number of vehicles has led to a shortage of parking spaces, causing congestion, traffic jams, and environmental pollution. Drivers waste significant time, fuel, and effort searching for parking, particularly during peak hours and festive seasons, often resulting in illegal street parking, which worsens traffic flow. This inefficient system contributes to fuel wastage, air pollution, and elevated greenhouse gas emissions. The problem calls for a smart parking solution that provides real-time information about parking availability, guiding drivers to free spaces efficiently. Such a system could reduce congestion, save fuel, and minimize environmental impact. By improving the overall parking experience, a smart parking solution would promote a more sustainable and eco-friendly urban environment.
